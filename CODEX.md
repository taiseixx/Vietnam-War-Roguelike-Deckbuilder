# CODEX.md

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge these with project-specific instructions in `AGENT.md` as needed.

Tradeoff: these guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

Do not assume. Do not hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:
- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them rather than picking silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so.
- Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop, name what is confusing, and ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No flexibility or configurability that was not requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask: would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:
- Do not improve adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Do not refactor things that are not broken.
- Match existing style, even if you would do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it rather than deleting it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports, variables, and functions that your changes made unused.
- Do not remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" -> "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass."
- "Fix the bug" -> "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass."
- "Refactor X" -> "Ensure tests pass before and after."

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] -> verify: [check]
2. [Step] -> verify: [check]
3. [Step] -> verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria, such as "make it work", require clarification.

These guidelines are working if diffs have fewer unnecessary changes, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions happen before implementation rather than after mistakes.
